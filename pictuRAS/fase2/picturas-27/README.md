# PictuRAS

**Your personal, intuitive and powerful image and video editor.**

PictuRAS is a web-based image and video editing platform that combines traditional image processing with AI-powered tools. It is built as a **microservices architecture** orchestrated with Docker Compose, and it is the code base for the group project of the curricular unit _Requisitos e Arquitetura de Software_ (RAS), University of Minho.

> **This repository is a starting point, not a finished product.**
> It is the result of two previous academic years of student work (see [AUTHORS.md](AUTHORS.md)). It contains working features, known limitations and technical debt — finding, documenting and improving those is part of your job this semester.

## 🚀 Features

### Core Image Processing

- **Basic Editing**: brightness, contrast, saturation adjustments
- **Geometric Operations**: resize, rotate, crop
- **Filters and Effects**: binarization, borders, watermark
- **Bulk Processing**: apply a pipeline of tools to multiple images

### Video Editing

- **Upload and playback**: MP4, MOV and WebM videos, validated on upload (container, codec,
  duration, size, resolution) with per-plan limits — free 60 s / 100 MB, premium 600 s / 1 GB
- **Video-only tools**: `trim` (start/end in seconds) and `speed` (factor 0.25–5)
- **Automatic subtitles**: local speech recognition (Faster-Whisper), captions burned into the
  video in the spoken language — see [Video Tools](#-video-tools)
- **Extract frames**: turn every video into up to 100 PNG/JPEG stills, by count or interval,
  as the last pipeline step
- **Shared effects**: brightness, contrast, saturation, binarization, border, resize, rotate and
  crop also apply to every frame of a video
- **Fast preview**: previews render only the first 3 s (`VIDEO_PREVIEW_SECONDS`)
- **Export**: always MP4 (H.264 + AAC), keeping the original audio
- AI tools, watermark and PDF export are image-only and hidden in projects that contain videos

### AI-Powered Tools

- **Background Removal** (`bg_remove_ai`): AI-powered background removal for clean cutouts
- **Smart Cropping** (`cut_ai`): saliency-based intelligent cropping
- **Object Detection** (`obj_ai`): object detection and classification with YOLO
- **People Detection** (`people_ai`): person detection and counting
- **Text Recognition** (`text_ai`): OCR for text extraction from images
- **Image Enhancement** (`upgrade_ai`): AI-driven quality improvement and upscaling
- **Generative Expand** (`expand_ai`): outpainting / canvas expansion, backed by a generative
  image API (a local **mock** of the Stable Diffusion WebUI API ships with the project, so no
  GPU or external API key is required)

### User Management and Platform

- **Authentication**: user registration and login with JWT
- **Field-level encryption**: sensitive user fields are encrypted at rest in MongoDB
- **Subscription Plans**: free and premium tiers with different daily usage limits
- **Project Management**: organise images and editing pipelines into projects
- **Real-time Processing**: WebSocket-based progress updates while tools run
- **Encrypted object storage**: SeaweedFS S3 with encryption at rest
- **Automated backups**: periodic `mongodump` of all three databases

## 🏗️ Architecture

All traffic enters the system through a single **HTTPS reverse proxy (Nginx)**. Internal services
are **not** published to the host unless noted otherwise — they talk to each other over the
`elk` Docker bridge network.

```

The **WS Gateway talks only to RabbitMQ**: it consumes `ws_queue` and pushes progress events to
the browser over Socket.IO, authenticating the connection with the shared `JWT_SECRET_KEY`. It
has no link to any other microservice. Note that **`subscriptions` means paid memberships**
(plans, cards, billing status) — it is unrelated to WebSocket/event subscriptions.

### Frontend

- **Technology**: Next.js 15 with React 19, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Container port**: 3000 — **not published**, reachable only through Nginx
- Talks to the backend through the relative base URL `/api-gateway/`

### Backend Services

| Service                   | Container port | Responsibility                                  |
| ------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **API Gateway**           | 8000           | Single entry point for the REST API, JWT checks |
| **User Service**          | 10001          | Registration, authentication, user profile      |
| **Project Service**       | 9001           | Projects, media pipelines, tool orchestration   |
| **Subscription Service**  | 11001          | Plans, payments (mock), usage limits            |
| **Image Storage Service** | 11000          | Upload/download façade in front of SeaweedFS    |
| **WebSocket Gateway**     | 4000           | Real-time progress events to the browser        |

### Processing Tools

Each tool is an independent Python microservice that consumes a RabbitMQ queue, processes the
image from the shared `image_data` volume, and publishes the result back to the `picturas`
exchange:

`binarization` · `border` · `brightness` · `contrast` · `cut` · `resize` · `rotate` ·
`saturation` · `watermark` · `bg_remove_ai` · `cut_ai` · `expand_ai` · `obj_ai` · `people_ai` ·
`text_ai` · `upgrade_ai`

> The `watermark` tool runs from a pre-built public image
> (`prcsousa/picturas-watermark-tool-ms`) instead of being built from this repository — it is a
> deliberate example of integrating a third-party service.

**Videos** are handled by a single worker, `video_tool` (`Tools/video/`), instead of the image
tools. For each video, `projects` sends **one** message with the whole pipeline to
`video_queue`; the worker probes the file with `ffprobe`, decodes it once, applies the frame
effects (`Tools/video/effects.py`, the same PIL operations as the image tools), encodes once to
MP4/H.264 + AAC and reports progress as `video-progress` events on `ws_queue`. It acknowledges
the message only at the end and leaves no partial output on failure. `ffmpeg` is installed only
inside this container. Automatic subtitles and frame extraction run as ordered stages of the
same worker (`Tools/video/subtitles.py`, `Tools/video/frame_extraction.py`).

### Infrastructure

- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ (asynchronous tool invocation)
- **Databases**: three independent MongoDB 4.4 instances (users, projects, subscriptions)
- **Object Storage**: SeaweedFS (S3-compatible) with encryption at rest

> **Why SeaweedFS?** The project originally used MinIO, whose container images were withdrawn
> from Docker Hub and quay.io in 2026, breaking every fresh build. SeaweedFS is S3-compatible,
> so only the endpoint and credentials changed — the application code still speaks plain S3 via
> `aws-sdk`. Encryption at rest is preserved through `-s3.encryptVolumeData`, which replaces
> MinIO's `MINIO_KMS_AUTO_ENCRYPTION`.

- **Reverse Proxy / TLS termination**: Nginx
- **Backups**: `mongo-backup` sidecar running `mongodump` every 24h into `./backups/mongo`
- **Monitoring**: ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) — present but **commented out**
  in `docker-compose.yaml` and `nginx/nginx.conf`

## 🛠️ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

| Requirement        | Minimum                   | Notes                                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Docker Engine**  | 24+                       | Docker Desktop on Windows/macOS                              |
| **Docker Compose** | v2 (`docker compose`)     | The old `docker-compose` (v1) hyphenated command is not used |
| **RAM**            | 8 GB free (16 GB advised) | ~25 containers, several with AI models loaded                |
| **Disk**           | ~15 GB free               | AI base images (PyTorch, OpenCV) are large                   |
| **Browser**        | Any modern browser        | Must accept a self-signed certificate                        |

On Docker Desktop, raise the memory limit in **Settings → Resources** if the AI tools get
OOM-killed.

> ⚠️ **Replacing your own Phase 1 version with this one?** Wipe your old Docker data first.
> Both versions use the same Compose project name (`picturas`), so this stack would reuse your
> old volumes — and the object storage layout changed (all files now live in one shared bucket,
> `users/<id>/…`, instead of one bucket per user). Old data is **not migrated**: with stale
> volumes, uploads and existing projects break in confusing ways.
>
> In the directory of your **old** checkout, before starting this one:
>
> ```bash
> docker compose down -v --remove-orphans   # deletes your old accounts, projects and files
> ```
>
> Then follow the installation below. This is needed only once. If you want to keep anything
> from your old instance, export it before running the command.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/picturas-um/picturas-27 picturas-27
   cd picturas-27
   ```

2. **Build and start the whole stack**

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

   The **first** build downloads several GB of images and installs the Python AI dependencies —
   expect **15–30 minutes** depending on your connection. Later starts take seconds:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d      # detached
   docker compose logs -f    # follow the logs
   ```

3. **Open the application**

   👉 **<https://localhost:8080>** — note the **`https`** and the port **`8080`**.

   Your browser will warn you about the self-signed certificate. Accept it
   (Chrome: _Advanced → Proceed to localhost (unsafe)_; Firefox: _Advanced → Accept the Risk_).
   See [HTTPS and Certificates](#-https-and-certificates) if the site does not load at all.

4. **Stop the stack**

   ```bash
   docker compose down          # stop and remove containers
   docker compose down -v       # ...and wipe all data (databases, images, objects)
   ```

### First Steps

1. Open <https://localhost:8080> and accept the certificate.
2. Register an account, or use the anonymous mode.
3. Create a project and upload an image or a video (samples in `samples/video/`).
4. Build a pipeline with the toolbar (filters, geometry, AI tools) and run it.
5. Watch the progress arrive live over the WebSocket, then download the results.

## 🔐 HTTPS and Certificates

Nginx terminates TLS on container port `443`, published on host port `8080`. A **self-signed**
certificate pair is committed to the repository so the stack works out of the box:

```
certs/selfsigned.crt      # used by Nginx — the only certificate the browser sees
certs/selfsigned.key
```

Five further self-signed pairs are committed under `apiGateway/`, `users/`, `projects/`,
`subscriptions/` and `frontend/`. The internal services use them to speak HTTPS to each other
(`https://users:10001`, `https://projects:9001`, ...).

The bundled certificate is issued to `CN=localhost` and is valid until **14 September 2027**, so
it covers the whole academic year. To regenerate it (for a different hostname, or after it
expires):

```bash
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 \
  -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -keyout certs/selfsigned.key \
  -out certs/selfsigned.crt \
  -subj "/CN=localhost" \
  -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:localhost,IP:127.0.0.1"

docker compose restart nginx
```

> ⚠️ **The internal certificates are expired, and that is why nothing breaks.**
> All five service-to-service pairs expired in **January 2026**. The stack keeps working
> because every client is built as `https.Agent({ rejectUnauthorized: false })`, so expiry —
> and in fact the whole certificate chain — is never checked. Internal traffic is encrypted
> but **not authenticated**, and the client certificates passed to those agents are never
> requested by any server. Treat this as a finding to analyse, not a pattern to copy: fixing
> it (proper validation, or dropping internal TLS in favour of a trusted network boundary) is
> a legitimate architectural improvement. Only `certs/`, used by Nginx, is still valid.

**Why HTTPS matters here:** the browser refuses to open a secure WebSocket (`wss://`) from a
page served over plain HTTP, and several browser APIs used by the editor require a secure
context. Always use `https://localhost:8080` — **not** `http://`, and **not** `localhost:3000`.

**Overriding with a `.env` file.** The object-storage variables are read from the environment,
with the defaults above applied when unset, so the stack runs with no setup. To use your own
credentials, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit it — `.env` is git-ignored, and a single
entry there updates both the storage server and the client that talks to it:

```bash
cp .env.example .env     # then edit, and: docker compose up -d
```

> 🔎 **Committed secrets are a known issue.** Private keys, JWT secrets and database passwords
> are hard-coded in this repository for convenience. That is acceptable for a local
> setup but _unacceptable in production_ — moving them to a `.env` file (git-ignored) or a secrets
> manager is a good first improvement.

⚠️ If you change `JWT_SECRET_KEY`, change it in **all three** services (`users`, `api_gateway`,
`ws_gateway`) or authentication silently breaks.

### Persistent data

Named Docker volumes: `user_data`, `project_data`, `subscription_data`, `image_data`,
`seaweedfs_data`, `rabbitmq_data`, `whisper_models` (speech model weights). Database dumps are
written to the host at `./backups/mongo` (git-ignored). `docker compose down -v` deletes every volume — the dumps survive.

### Scaling

- Run more instances of a busy tool: `docker compose up -d --scale brightness_tool=3`
- Watch queue depth in the RabbitMQ management UI (<http://localhost:15672>)
- Tune per-container CPU/memory limits in `docker-compose.yaml` to match your machine

Containers are named `picturas-<service>-<n>` (from `name: picturas` in `docker-compose.yaml`),
independently of the directory you cloned into. Use `docker compose -p <other-name>` to run a
second, separate stack.

### Enabling the ELK stack (optional)

The Elasticsearch / Logstash / Kibana services are commented out at the top of
`docker-compose.yaml`, together with the matching `location` blocks in `nginx/nginx.conf`.
Uncomment both to enable centralised logging — budget an extra ~4 GB of RAM.

## 🎬 Video Tools

Besides `trim` and `speed`, projects with videos have two project-wide, video-only tools. Both
run inside the existing `video_tool` worker; images in the same project skip them.

### Automatic subtitles

Choose **Automatic subtitles** in the toolbar and **Save**. **Apply** burns captions into every
video of the project, in the detected spoken language (no translation). Videos without audio or
without detected speech are left unchanged by this step, and original uploads are never
overwritten.

- Recognition runs locally with [Faster-Whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper)
  `small` on CPU/int8 — no external API or key. The first use downloads the model weights into
  the `whisper_models` volume; later runs reuse them.
- Order matters: tools placed after subtitles also change the captioned video, so put subtitles
  after `trim`/`speed` and other edits.
- Preview shows the first 3 s of the final timeline. Subtitle previews may take up to ten
  minutes on first use (model download, queued CPU work).
- Transcription can contain errors. Captions are not editable and there is no SRT export.
- Configured with `WHISPER_MODEL`, `WHISPER_CACHE_DIR` and `WHISPER_CPU_THREADS` (see
  [Configuration](#-configuration)). The worker image ships Noto fonts for multilingual captions.

Adapted from the Phase 1 submission of group **PL2-G5** (see [AUTHORS.md](AUTHORS.md)), which
exported text tracks instead of burning captions into the video.

### Extract frames

Choose **Extract frames**, pick either a number of evenly spaced frames (1–100) or one frame
every _N_ seconds, choose PNG or JPEG, and **Save**. **Apply** turns every video of the project
into still images.

- Extraction is always the **last** step and appears at most once; new effects are inserted
  before it and invalid reorderings are rejected. Trim, speed, subtitles and other preceding
  edits are reflected in the frames.
- Sampling starts at 0 s on the edited timeline and excludes its end. At most 100 frames per
  video: an interval that would produce more is rejected rather than silently truncated.
- **Preview** shows a contact sheet of up to six samples across the whole edited video (which
  can be slow when there are preceding effects). **Results** lists each frame as a separate
  image with a unique name, for individual download or in the project ZIP.
- With no preceding effects, frames are read directly from the original, without re-encoding.

Adapted from the Phase 1 submissions of groups **PL2-G5** (interval sampling, bounded output)
and **PL5-G6** (count-based PNG/JPEG extraction, frame manifest with timestamps) — see
[AUTHORS.md](AUTHORS.md).

### Playback

Videos never autoplay or loop: they play only when started, and pause when you leave their
carousel slide or close the preview.

## 💻 Development Workflow

### Rebuilding a single service

```bash
docker compose up -d --build users        # rebuild + restart one service
docker compose restart nginx              # config-only change, no rebuild needed
docker compose logs -f projects           # follow one service's logs
docker compose ps                         # what is running, and is it healthy?
```

### Live code reloading

`users`, `subscriptions`, `apiGateway` and `frontend` bind-mount their source directory into
the container, so edits on the host are visible inside it. The Node services run under
`nodemon` and reload automatically.

The **frontend image is built for production** (`bun run build` / `bun start`), so a source edit
will **not** hot-reload. For frontend development either rebuild:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build frontend
```

...or switch `frontend/Dockerfile` to the dev command already prepared there
(`CMD ["bun", "dev"]`, commented out at the bottom of the file).

Python tools have no bind mount — rebuild them after every change:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build border_tool
```

### Testing the video worker

The tests run on the host, with no image to build. They only need Python 3.11+ and
`ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` on the `PATH` (`brew install ffmpeg`, `apt install ffmpeg`, ...):

```bash
cd Tools/video
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements-dev.txt   # once
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests
```

Without ffmpeg on the host, run them in the already-built worker image instead:
`docker compose run --rm video_tool sh -c "pip install -q pytest && python -m pytest -q tests"`.

The media tests use real FFmpeg; speech recognition is simulated, so no model is downloaded.
The orchestration tests for the video pipeline and frame extraction run inside `projects`:

```bash
docker compose run --rm --no-deps projects sh -c "node --test tests/*.test.js"
```

For manual tests, `samples/video/` has a valid 10 s 720p MP4, a MOV, a 90 s video that the free
plan must reject and a corrupted file — see its `README.md` for the expected result of each.

### Adding a new tool

1. Create `Tools/<your_tool>/` with `<your_tool>.py`, `requirements.txt` and a `Dockerfile`
   (copy an existing simple tool such as `border` as a template).
2. Reuse `Tools/utils/` for RabbitMQ connection, image handling and message schemas.
3. Register the queue in `rabbitMQ/`.
4. Add the service to `docker-compose.yaml` with `depends_on: rabbitmq (service_healthy)` and
   the `image_data` volume.
5. Expose it in the project service and in the frontend toolbar.

### Inspecting data

```bash
docker compose exec users_mongoDB mongo --port 27019
docker compose exec projects_mongoDB mongo --port 27018
```

Stored objects: <http://localhost:9090> (SeaweedFS filer UI).
Queues and message rates: <http://localhost:15672> (`user` / `password`).

## 🩹 Troubleshooting

**The page does not load / `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`**
You are probably using `http://` instead of `https://`, or port `3000` instead of `8080`. The
only correct address is <https://localhost:8080>.

**"Your connection is not private" / `NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID`**
Expected — the certificate is self-signed. Accept the warning once per browser profile. If
Chrome refuses outright, type `thisisunsafe` with the warning page focused.

**Uploads or live updates fail although the page loads**
The browser blocks mixed content and insecure WebSockets. Make sure every request goes through
`https://localhost:8080` and that `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` stays the **relative** value
`/api-gateway/`.

**`Bind for 0.0.0.0:8080 failed: port is already allocated`**
Another process holds the port. Find it with `lsof -i :8080` (macOS/Linux) or
`netstat -ano | findstr :8080` (Windows) and stop it. Do not remap Nginx to another host
port: `FRONTEND_URL` and the frontend's WebSocket URL both assume `8080`, so the page would
load while presigned image URLs and live updates kept pointing at the old port.

**A tool container keeps restarting**
Check `docker compose logs <tool>_tool`. The usual causes are RabbitMQ not being healthy yet
(it recovers on its own) or the container being OOM-killed — increase Docker's memory limit.

**AI tools are very slow the first time**
Some models are downloaded or warmed up on first use. `Tools/models/yolov5su.pt` is committed,
but other weights are fetched at runtime — the first request needs network access.

**A video upload is rejected**
The response gives the reason: check the plan limits (free 60 s / 100 MB) and that the file
is a valid MP4, MOV or WebM. Videos must go to `POST /:user/:project/video`; the image
endpoint rejects them.

**A video stays at 0% or never finishes**
There is a single `video_tool` with no replicas, so videos are processed one at a time. Check
`docker compose logs -f video_tool` and the depth of `video_queue` in RabbitMQ.

**`expand_ai` fails**
It depends on `generative-mock` being healthy. Check <http://localhost:7860> and
`docker compose logs generative-mock`.

**Login works, then every request returns 401**
`JWT_SECRET_KEY` differs between `users`, `api_gateway` and `ws_gateway`.

**Everything is broken after pulling new code**
Rebuild from a clean slate:

```bash
docker compose down -v
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up
```

**Out of disk space**
`docker system prune -a --volumes` reclaims unused images and volumes — it also **deletes your
local data**, so use it deliberately.
